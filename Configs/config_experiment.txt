Configuration of the study zone
#
## This file allows to configurate the study zone
## We are interested for the z range, t range, FTHit and we need the mu-factor and the bench-crossing rate of the experiment
#
# Fill the interesting z-range in cm
min_z:1
max_z:237
#
# Fill the interesting FTHits-range - do not fill if useless
min_FTHit:
max_FTHit:
# Fill the event rate of the experiment (in kHz)
event_rate:100
#
# Fill the number of bit needed by hit
nb_of_bit_BX_id:12
